    "\n",
    "A line strength, quantified by its **equivalent width** ($\\omega_{\\lambda}$), can tell us about the abundance of the relevant element in a star's atmosphere. However, the most important factor determining line strength is temperature. Al low temperatures transitions involving an initial energy above the ground state are rare, and the corresponding lines are weak. It also happens that at very high temperatures, most atoms are ionised and transitions involving neutral atoms will be rare.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2.2.2 Stellar classes / 2.2.3 Using spectra to classify stars\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that line strength depends on temperature, we can use the relative line stregths of a star spectrum to estimate its class. That is, stars can be classified using photospheric temperatures. \n",

    "### 2.2.4 Luminosity and spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a narrow-deep and a shallow-wide line could have the same strength, the widths of spectral lines tell us about their luminosities. A more luminous star will have narrower lines than a less luminous star with the same temperature, and therefore will have a larger radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because the smaller star has a more dense atmosphere and their atoms collide and interact with each other more frequently, producing small random changes in their energy levels and making the absortion lines more unexpected, and the absortion line broader (**pressure broadening**). This provides a way to measure the luminosity of a star from the widths of its absorption lines.\n",

    "The **Morgan-Keenan** spectral system supplements the temperature based classes of the Harvard system with **luminosty classes** ranging from I (mot luminous) to V (less luminous).\n",

    "### 2.2.5 Composition and spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative abundances of different elements in a star atmostphere can also be determined from its spectrum. However, we can't just compare specific lines between stars because their strength will also **depend strongly on temperature**. To void this problem, a combination of line stregths from many **different lines associated with each element** are used.\n",

    "In practice, the observed spectrum of a star is compared with template spectra generated from a wide range of synthetic model star atmospheres, allowing us to classify them and identify its tempeature, luminosity, and composition.\n",

    "The standard form plots Luminosity in units of solar luminosity ($L/L_{\\odot}$) against effective surface temperature in kelvin (T/K). Both axes are logarithmic scales. Temperature increases towards the left. Colour density indicates population density.\n",
