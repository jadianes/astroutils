Given that the effective surface temperature is measured to be ~5780K, this variation in brightness tells us that temperature must increase with photospheric depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sunspot motion reveals to us that the Sun is rotating, and given that rotation periods depend on latutitude, we conclude that the Sun rotates faster at the equator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sun also experiences radial (int and out) motions on its surface, producing **solar granules** which change over a few minutes. They are convection cells caused by the upwelling of hot material from the solar interior, which cools as it moves outward from the center of the granule and the sinks back in towards the granule edges.\n",

    "We can use absorption line broadening in stellar spectra to detect **rotation**.\n",

    "### 2.1.3 Internal structure: gravity and pressure balance\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature increases with depth in the Sun's photosphere. This trend continues through the star's interior because this **temperature gradient** is needed to allow the outward flow of energy from the core to the star's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the Sun radius is stable, we can conclude the force of gravity pulling material inwards **is in balance** with the outward pressure exerted by material within the Sun. The long-term stability of stars requires that this balance holds true at every radius within the star (**hydrostatic equilibrium**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This outward pressure is proportional to material temeprature and density. We can assume that material that makes the Sun behaves as an **ideal gas** satisfying\n",
    "\n",

These photons cannot travel directly from the core to the surface due to the gas density, and need to make it to the surface via encounters with other particles. They are scattered, absorbed and re-emitted many times along the way in a random walk.\n",
